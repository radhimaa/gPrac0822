        Learnt commit reset and file restore  <br>
        git reset 1st commitID <br>
        restoring to first commit from 3rd commit <br>
        then file restore <br>
        in one of the commits a file was deleted <br>
        then git status <br>

        git status <br>
        shows the deleted file as unstaged along with untracked new file<br>
        then with git add . <br>
        <u> git consider as old file with new name it got renamed</u> <br>
        <u> and git recorded as renamed </u><br>
